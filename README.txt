This is an attempt to build a comic book archive [1] reader using only open web technologies:

  * File API
  * Canvas
  * HTML5
  
Initial target is support for CBZ files, which means first step is implementing ZIP file [2]
reading in the browser.

Please contact me [2] directly if you wish to participate or start opening issues.

Regards,
Jeff
